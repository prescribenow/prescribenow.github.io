          Patients can be searched according to their age, gender and clinical
          data. Find the first two options under the ‘Demographics’ section.
          Clinical data is at the bottom left of the screen.<br />
          If age becomes the searching criteria, enter a number depicting the
          age of the patient. Use less than ‘<’, or greater than ‘>’, or equal
          to ‘=’ or ‘between’ to successfully search for required patient name.
          Select ‘Generate List’ to execute the search. Below is an example of a
