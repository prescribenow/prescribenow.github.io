          A patient’s portal setup is different than a Provider’s portal. The
          interface is simpler and contains fewer options.

        At the left part of the screen are four options, namely: Home,
        Appointments, Prescriptions and Messages.<br />
        ‘Home’ is used to bring user to the main screen, regardless of what
        screen is open. ‘Appointments’ displays all appointments booked against
        the patient. Prescriptions reveal particulars of medication that the
        patient has been using for some time. Messages show messages that the
        patient has exchanged with healthcare providers regarding his or her
        disease.
