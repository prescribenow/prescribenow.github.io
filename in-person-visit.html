      <p class="info">
        An in-person visit refers to a traditional, face-to-face meeting between
        a healthcare provider and patient. Numerous individuals contribute to
        the care of a patient, from the moment they arrive at a healthcare
        facility until the time they depart. Some of these people are
        physicians, physician assistants, nurses, medical assistants, and
        billing specialists.<br /><br />
        An In-Person visit starts when a patient has registered an appointment
        with a physician. This detail is shown to a responsible person known as
        Staff. Staff is responsible for checking-in the patient and assigning
        him or her an examination room titled here as ‘Exam Room’.
