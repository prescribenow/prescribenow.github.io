      <p class="info">
        In an online health-care environment, a ‘Tenant’ is usually referred to
        as a specific department, unit, or a separate healthcare facility that
        uses the software. Each tenant has its own unique settings to tailor the
        software to its specific needs.<br /><br />
        The ‘Settings’ feature comprises of five headings. They are:<br />

        i. Practice Information<br />
        ii. Appointment Settings<br />
        iii. Notification Settings<br />
        iv. PayPal Settings<br />
        v. Subscription Details<br />

        Let us look into each heading in detail.
