          Virtual appointments are booked for convenience, accessibility,
          minimizing travel, and addressing non-emergency medical concerns. If a
          ‘Virtual’ appointment is booked, the ‘Facilities’ option will not be
          displayed. These appointments are remote in nature.<br />
          ‘In-Person’ appointments involves physically visiting a healthcare
          provider's location for a face-to-face consultation or examination.
          When this type of appointment is booked, the ‘Facilities’ option is
