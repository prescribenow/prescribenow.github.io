        "Provider onboarding" is the process of bringing new healthcare

          Enter all relevant information, such as name, email and mobile phone.
          All text fields with an asterisk must be filled out as a requirement.
          ‘User Role’ refers to the specific role or access level that will be
          assigned to you. User roles are defined to ensure that individuals
          have appropriate access and permissions within the software.<br />
          The chosen user role determines the specific fields that are
          accessible to you. As an illustration, a physician needs to provide
          their 'NPI' number and 'Specialty,' whereas a 'Nurse Practitioner' is
          only expected to complete the 'Specialty' section.
