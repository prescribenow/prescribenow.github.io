        2. The above screen opens in front of you. Search for and add the
        patient’s name. Select ‘In-Person’ if patient will physically appear for
        a medical examination in the hospital. Select ‘Virtual’ if the patient
        and healthcare provider will connect through video conferencing to
        discuss medical concerns. <br /><br />
        3. Select the facility under ‘Facilities’. If the appointment is
        ‘Virtual’, the ‘Facilities’ option will not appear. This is because a
        provider is not bound to attend to a virtual patient from any particular
        facility. <br /><br />
        4. Choose your health care provider under ‘Provider’. If you select
        ‘Any’, time slots of all providers registered in the same state as the
        patient will be displayed.

          5. ‘Appointment Type’ has three selectable options by default.
          ‘Consultation’ is chosen when a new patient is to be treated or a
          registered patient with a new illness needs to be seen by a physician.
          If you select ‘Follow Up Appointment’, another field titled ‘Past
          Appointments’ will appear. Select the past appointment to align with
          the upcoming follow up. ‘Custom Appointment’ is used in emergencies.
          It allows you to choose a physician who may not be scheduled. It also
          allows you to pick a time and duration (of appointment) of your
          choosing.
