          Patients are people who visit a healthcare facility to seek treatment
          and undergo examinations. Their health records, personal information,
          medical history, diagnoses, and treatment details are stored within
          the facility. This ensures delivery of quality healthcare while
          guaranteeing patient safety.<br />
          The ‘Patients’ page can be accessed from the home screen. When
          selected, it displays a list of patients with their name, gender, age,
          and date of birth.
